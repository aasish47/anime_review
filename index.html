            Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
            Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young
            ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming
            the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two
            parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in
            his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto:
            Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
            Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto
            (1997).

            he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification
            similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki.
            His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending
            humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the
            afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on,
            the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines
            and characters not found in the manga.
